Overview :
This project controls a servo motor and stepper motors to draw numbers and letters on a surface using an Arduino. The system interprets predefined functions for each character, moving the motors accordingly.

Features :
Supports drawing digits (0-9) and uppercase letters (A-Z).
 Uses a servo motor to lift and lower the drawing tool.
Moves in X and Y directions to trace the shapes.
Implements diagonal movements for accurate letter formation.
Includes helper functions for precise stepper motor control.


Installation & Usage

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

    Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to your Arduino board.
    Connect the motors and verify wiring as per the pin configuration.
    Power up the system and observe the drawing process.

Functions Overview

    Servo Control: zd() (pen down), zu() (pen up)
    Movement: xmovef(), xmoveb(), ymovef(), ymoveb() (stepper motor control)
    Character Drawing: num0(), num1(), ..., alpA(), alpB(), ..., alpZ()
    Diagonal Movement: northeast(), southwest(), etc.
